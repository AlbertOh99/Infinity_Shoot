INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PLAY:
MOVEMENT:
W - FORWARD
S - BACKWARD
A - LEFT
D - RIGHT

Space - Jump (To do a double jump press space while in the air)
Aim - Use the mouse to look around
Shoot - Left mouse button

Point of the game is to get the highest score as possible while dodging the enemy. Enemies will
occationally drop health packs that heal the player for a bit of their missing HP. Ammo is infinate.

Every sprite except for the enemy squares are from the unity asset store.
The music is from the asset store as well. The lazer sound is from zapsplat.com
Player model is also from the asset store.

General Notes To Get Better

I spent too much time on unnecessary things for a prototype.
I didn't need to worry about the player model being some kind of dummy, I could have just
used a cylinder but instead I wasted a bunch of time on a useless feature in a prototype.
Same with trying to 3D model/draw some of the assets. I spend a considerable amount of time
on something that I never used and could just find place holders for in the asset store for now.
I need to remember a prototype doesn't need to be fancy but functional. So I wasted a bunch of time
trying to make poop look nice. I should have focused more of the game design aspects instead of
visuals (not that the visuals even look great).

Some thing that I want to add if I want to -
- Possibly make procedually generated rooms that work well (so not just randomly placed platforms)
- Gun upgrades - Increase bullet speed/fire rate.
- Different guns
- Movement/player upgrade - Increase speed, extra mid-air jumps, increase in max HP.
- Make the death screen look nicer.
- Make a slider for customizable sensitivity for aiming.
- Music/sound effect sliders
- Add more variety to the enemies
